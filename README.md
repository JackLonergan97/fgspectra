# fgspectra
Foreground SED and power spectrum library for building cross frequency power spectrum models.

We'll eventually pull in code/refernce material from
* fgbuster
* BeFore
* tile-c
* Erminia/Jo's multifrequency likelihood on Lambda


# Contributing
Following `pixell`, let's try to write [numpy docstrings](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) and PEP8 compliant code.

# Dependencies
* Python > 3
* numpy / scipy

# Installing
Since we're still putting this together, just install in developer mode for now.

```
pip install -e .
```
