# fgspectra
Foreground SED and power spectrum library for building cross frequency power spectrum models.

We'll eventually pull in code/reference material from
* [fgbuster](https://github.com/fgbuster/fgbuster)
* [BeFore](https://github.com/damonge/BFoRe_py)
* [tile-c](https://github.com/ACTCollaboration/tile-c)
* [Erminia/Jo's multifrequency likelihood on Lambda](https://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/act/act_fulllikelihood_get.cfm)


## Contributing
Following `pixell`, let's try to write [numpy docstrings](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) and PEP8 compliant code.

## Dependencies
* Python > 3
* numpy / scipy

## Installing
Since we're still putting this together, just install in developer mode for now.

```
pip install -e .
```

## Testing

Run `pytest` in the `fgspectra` directory.
